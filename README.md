# Sync-v4
This is part 4 of 4 versions of sync guis, back in the day when I barely had any knowledge of how to script I produced a generic gui, with no real functions. Now in part 4, there are many more options to choose from.

Features:

- Antimute (shitty)
- Distort/Pitch/TimePosition for boombox remotes
- Antilog (shitty but 6/10)
- Passive Sync; Basically chooses whether or not to fire a remote for syncing, or simply set time position instead.
- Resync; Re-synchronizes all your audios so it produces a harmonious effect. And that's about it!
